		<h1>Affordable Housing</h1>
        <div id="section-introduction" class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>A general rule for 'Affordable' housing, otherwise known as 'Social' Housing is a cost that does not
                    exceed 30%
                    of household gross income - the cost including local taxes, energy costs and water services. Not an
                    easy thing
                    to work out.</p>
                <p>A previous book 'Job file 1960 - 1992' lists 176 building jobs carried out by architects Philip
                    Cocker and
                    Partners
                    and 66 abortive designs. Of the built work 64 are of multiple house contracts of which most fall
                    into the
                    category currently known as 'affordable' housing. This earlier book of 2003 is mainly photographs
                    with just
                    basic information - site, date, client and contract value and a few layout drawings. The new
                    internet
                    availability of satellite maps and three dimensional aerial photography, together with the
                    probability of much
                    of the immediate future U.K. housing construction having to be fairly basic, inspire this
                    retrospective look at
                    what one architectural practice did during a previous period of financial stringency.</p>
                <p>The satellite photography is of varying quality and has been selected as being the best offered by
                    the two main
                    providers. Sometimes the is no coverage at all. Drawn layouts provide a mere detailed image of a
                    group of
                    houses, but the big advantage of the sat' pics is that they show the current state on the ground now
                    after up to
                    over 40 years of use and also shows particularly well how the green landscape has fared and whether
                    the
                    provision of car parking is working.</p>
                <p>All this may only be of passing interest to the general public, despite the vast media fuelled
                    interest in their
                    own and prospective homes, but when design work resumes with new non 'Luxury Executive' budgets , a
                    few pointers
                    may be gleaned by the professionals from these examples from the past. At least it is logging of a
                    particular
                    part of housing history.</p>

            <h2>Housing Statistics</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The latest figures for the U.K. indicate a population of British born nationals of 53.9 million plus
                    foreign born
                    nationals of 6.5 million - total 60.4 million. The number of houses is about 25 million. On a
                    replacement
                    requirement of 100 years that is 250,000 new houses per year. Additional new houses are constantly
                    demanded in
                    normal times at perhaps the same number, so the new build figure of 500,000 houses per year is
                    frequently
                    mentioned. There have never been more than 300,000 build in the U.K. (in the 50's) so there is
                    really a problem
                    which can never be solved, unless the 800,000 owners of overseas houses moved abroad. An interesting
                    idea.</p>
                <p>On the other hand there is a big percentage of holiday houses in some areas which are only 90%
                    occupied and
                    thousands of empty blighted early Victorian streets in northern English towns controversially
                    awaiting
                    redevelopment.</p>
                <p>The other question is whether the English population will continue to rise because of immigration and
                    natural
                    growth or not. Natural growth in major European countries such as France, Italy and Spain has
                    already slowed as
                    it has in Japan and of course China has struggled to restrict growth for some years now.</p>
                <p>In Scotland the population is static at about 5 million, immigration is modest so the requirement is
                    for
                    replacement and some perceived new build. With a stock of 2.3 million houses the replacement
                    requirement would
                    be
                    23,000 per annum. Over the past few years the new build has been about 25k per year, so where is the
                    problem?
                    Shelter Scotland insist there are 200,000 on the various council waiting lists. The situation is
                    confused,
                    particularly when the E.U. tell us the U.K. population is header for 71m in 2030.</p>

            <h2>Housing Standards</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>In Scotland, the industrial revolution of the 19th century and consequent population explosion
                    increased demand
                    for shelter much beyond the supply. The Glasgow authorities reacted with the 'Ticketing' of tenement
                    rooms
                    with the maximum sleeping body count allowed, based on 300 cubic feet per person. Just enough space
                    to sleep,
                    have a personal box and turn around in. Do not ask about night soil. These measures were followed by
                    the
                    building of 'Model Lodging Houses' and 'Model Family Tenements' to demonstrate more decent
                    standards. These
                    tenements in the 1860's were restricted to four storys with 'single ends' (one room) and two room
                    flats, each
                    hroom having a fireplace and generally a recess for a 4' x 6' 'Scotch Double' bed. A communical
                    water closet
                    could be found off the stais half landing with an outside wall. Back courts were as little as 55ft.
                    wide and
                    front streets about 50ft. minimum. These distances were to allow fresh air to circulate the streets
                    as it was
                    hoped that this would help to reduce the many epidemics of the diseases that swept through towns as
                    that time.
                    The rebuilding of Paris with wide streets was to help the army to keep down the revolting lower
                    classes - a
                    different problem. Good clean water supplies and good drainage was in fact the way to healthy licing
                    and this
                    work proceeded along with the new tenements.</p>
                <p>
                    In Edibuburgh, tenements had been built in the Old Town to a massive 15 storeys in parts, but
                    occasional
                    collapses and more frequent fire disasters curbed the appetite for height and with the development
                    of the New
                    Town a maximum of four storeys was the norm. In general the New Town houses were ar from
                    'affordable' but some
                    more modest tenements were built, kind of out of sight, but as the privileged moved out of the Old
                    Town, other
                    lesser mortals moved in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Progress with the provision of tenement property was slow but steady. In Glasgow, Edinburgh and the
                    other
                    Scottish cities and towns, despite setbacks like several Great and lesser wars and the collapse of
                    The City of
                    Glasgow Bank in 1878 which ruined most of the builders for decased and interesetingly put the
                    directors in jail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A major shift occurred after the 1914/18 war when 'Homes fit for Heroes' was the cry, and Garden
                    Cities were the
                    new answer. Tenement flats had progresses and the best had full bathrooms and seperate kitchens and
                    some flats
                    for the better off were quite large. New developments in many areas were based on Garden City
                    principles and
                    Council built streets included semi-detatched two story houses with all mod cons and floor areas of
                    around 1100
                    sq. ft. Private developers were also busy building large areas of detached bungalows of similar
                    floor areas.
                    This type of building took up more land of course which at the time was probably not expensive.
                    During WW2 house
                    building ceased and in 1945 there was the old shortage problem again. The Labour government
                    concentrated all
                    avaoilable resources on council house building after giving exports top priority. This took the form
                    of two
                    storey terraced housing, some 3 and 4 storey flats and a large number of multi-story flats in the
                    major cities.
                    The low rise building was by and large fit for purpose, if often uninspired, but the high rise
                    programme, much
                    of it built with new and untested systems, were expensive, and without property management was often
                    a failure.
                    The high rises were also subsidised much more than other development, an anomoly which was justified
                    by the need
                    to create space for new city roads and redevelopment wriggle room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    House areas during this period started off with the Bevan ideal of 1000 sq.ft for a family house,
                    but this was
                    reduced to 850 sq.ft in the early 50's to hit P.M. McMillan's 300,000 house target. This was lifted
                    back to 1000
                    in the 60's after the 'Parker Morris' Report. The 80's brought new Building Regulations which
                    modified area
                    standards so that 850 again would do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the 90's the accent was on 'Executive Luxury' development and 'Social' and 'Affordable' only
                    applied to a
                    minority of houses and flats'. During all of this yo-yo-ing the modest standard of 9sq.m per person
                    was the rule
                    for all the old Soviety Block except for the 'Nomenclatura' privileged classes, and probably still
                    applies even
                    though Russia has a reducing population. By contract it has been said that new build houses in the
                    Netherlands
                    are 50% larger than in the U.K. There there is the internationally respected Japanese mathematics
                    Professor who
                    has lived for many years in a 9 sq.m room. He eats out of course but loves it.

                    Reference has been made to 'Indifferent' low rise design and the failures of high rises. Why is this
                    so? A
                    recent report by the English government watchdog C.A.B.E. (Commision for Architecture and the Built
                    Environment)
                    says that "we have douns that just 18% of new social homes meet a good or very good standard. This
                    means that
                    the design of four fifths of homes is average, poor or very poor. The findings echo those of a study
                    of private
                    housing conducted by C.A.B.E. between 2001 and 2007 which found that exactly the same number were
                    average, poor
                    or very poor."
                </p>
                <p>
                    What boxes are C.A.B.E. ticking? It used to be 'Shelter, access and services, form, colour and
                    texture' plus
                    green stuff if appropriate. It was always going to be hard to tick all the boxes with say hundreds
                    of two storey
                    terraced houses with catalogue windows and porridge like roughcaste walls. History shows that
                    quality is a rare
                    commodity and will probably stay so.

                    Some recent studies have concluded that compact urban settlements are the most efficient by all
                    criteria. The
                    natural evolvement of existing towns and cities confirms this view. Building at low densities is not
                    thereforse
                    a reasonable option for large increments of housing building, so the choice ranges between the most
                    popular
                    familiy densities of 5/7 d.p.a. and a more uban density of 25/30 d.p.a. plus a small proportion at
                    higher
                    densities in the larget cities. In normal times and given a choice families will migrate to suit
                    their pocket
                    and choice. Again this is what has happened in free markets. A recent 'Mori' poll indicates that 95%
                    of people
                    want to live in a house and only 3% prefer a flat, a result which is not surprising but is hardly
                    likely to be
                    realised. One aspect of medium densities which has been somewhat unremarked, is the benefit of an
                    improved
                    microclimate in two storey courtyards and gardens. Aerial photographs demonstrate how very urban and
                    dense
                    seeming front streets hide luxuriant back gardens and how valuable they are. Another interesting
                    factor in
                    cities is how oftern in a couple of centuries certain areas have been redeveloped over and over
                    again. Think of
                    Edinburgh High street or Glasgow Govan. It is never impossible to redevelop an area, hopefully
                    better than
                    before.

                    Over the three centuries of serious housebuilding in the U.K. development has been achieved by
                    various agencies,
                    Industrial companies - Bournville, New Lanark etc landowners and builders - City trusts - local Town
                    and
                    District Councils and Housing Associations of various types. In terms of quantity and speed the
                    largest cities
                    in the post W.W.2. push build several thousands each for many years to good effect. In Scotland the
                    Government
                    agency S.S.H.A. (Scottish Special Housing Agency) assisted by building 110,000 houses between 1940
                    and 1985.
                    Tellingly it is apopcryphal that not a single S.S.H.A site was started with complete legal
                    possession.

                    In recent years much affordable housing has been achieved only because developers have been required
                    to provide
                    a proportion of it in thier housing developments. When the market recovers from the current problems
                    this may
                    not be possible, or maybe for a while most housing will have to be 'Affordable' for economic
                    reasons. In fact a
                    wide range of providers is always going to be advisable.

                <p>
                    In considering 'Affordability' history indicates that some subsidy is required at some point in the
                    delivery
                    chain and will be so for a long time. How to do this is something the politicians will argue about
                    forever.

                    'The art of foretelling the progress of a disease.' This definition by Collins is very appropriate
                    if you are on
                    the side of the nimbys. The developments illustrated here were fairly typical of the time when they
                    were built.
                    The noble intention was to provide families with comfortable houses in a pleasant environment and to
                    provider
                    maximum density consistent with proper amenity, but of course the world is paved with good
                    intentions. Some
                    csiriticisms are noted in the brief commentaries by an involved but remote observer. Remote because
                    of the need
                    to get on with the next job with only very limited return visits to completed work. It is
                    frustrating as an
                    arhictect churning out designes year after year, quite happily of course - but however close to
                    clients, there
                    is very little feedback from the owners or tenants on the important subject of life in our houses.
                    Technical,
                    professional and lay magazines occassionally have useful feedback content but no recent academic
                    studies seem to
                    have been made and disseminated. Maybe there is if one lookes, byt one problem is that most
                    architects
                    arrogantly feel that they know exactly what is required, but the C.A.B.E comments suggests that many
                    designers
                    are actually floundering about. Looking at some recent developments of tightly packed lacklistre
                    four storey
                    flats and non stop boxes of detacthed 'villas', one wonders if artchitects were employed at all. It
                    is stil
                    quite feasible for a good draughtsman to knock up a set of drawings for a large scheme of repetitive
                    housing.

                    The planning system has not been discussed in this study, perhaps because the subject is too big for
                    here and
                    curiously at the end of the day has only a minimal effect on things but seems to have been unable to
                    produce
                    consistently good results. The Planning system is probably as good as it might get but Planning
                    staff could
                    probably assume more 'can do' rather than 'no can do' attitudes. Easy to say and the tripartite
                    interests of
                    developers, planning staff and elected members are likely to persist permanently, not to mention the
                    poll that
                    tells us that 85% of the population object to the development of everything, anywhere.

                    A penultimate note on a neglected but perennial subject - prefabs. Prefabrication has developed much
                    since the
                    quite succesfful post W.W.2. prefab programme and perhaps it should be tried again for the lower
                    densities. Not
                    please with imports, there is much experienced expertise in the U.K. parricularly Scotland. Allow a
                    generous
                    budget for green landscape and a quality tiled roof. The public will take to them.

                    A final note in this section is about sheltered housing which must be a growth industry. This can
                    take many
                    forms and have various lifestyle specifications but all types will assist in using the housing stock
                    as
                    efficiently as possible.

                    Towards the end of the last squeeze we were pushing the envelope in two directions. One downwards in
                    that the
                    minimal spec. of a useful flat should be two bed flat - one double and one single. This was much
                    more useful
                    than a one bed two person flat, as the sinfle room could be used with a double bund bed for small
                    children for
                    perhaps a year or so. This could be achieved in a D.o.E. book area of 46 sq.m for a two person flat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other direction was upwards, in that some 3 bed flats were given two bathrooms - a move towards
                    more
                    comfortable living.

                    Who knows what economies will have to be made or if any, when the slump lifts. in the 50's one
                    authority left
                    off the bath panel to save 10s. (50p now) and another left the interior painting to tenants. As late
                    as 1975 a
                    major houses builder 'pioneered' a bed-sit flat of about 28 sq.m. which was much featured
                    nationally, but
                    quietly dropped within a short time. Probably the market did not like it. The housing problems of
                    the U.K. and
                    Europe pale by comparison with the developing rest of the world, and the only answer to this is only
                    just
                    creeping back on to the agenda.

                        Revised and slightly extended in December 2010. The only fresh comment is that the housing
                        situation in both the
                        U.K. and Scotland is probably worse than in March 2009

                    <p>To get an accurate assesment of the development possibilities of a new site under consideration,
                        some kind of
                        design sketches have to be made. A survey somtimes, a check on the Planning situation is also
                        required and, the
                        services available togetehr with any special foundation problems. Questions are obviously asked
                        about the price
                        of the development and before you know it a lot of time has been spent in and outside the
                        office. This happened
                        all the time and here is a list of the sites which were looked at in this way, 27 as far as
                        memory serves. Eight
                        were actually paid for the and the rest carried out for existing Housing Association and
                        developer clients, or
                        new clients on a pro bono scratchback system. On the whole these shcmes were good practive but
                        two or three went
                        too far, collapsed for whatever reason without and fee, and left quite a sour taste in the
                        mouth.

                        Houses for individual clients can consume a disproportionate amount of time, but fortunately
                        only three modest

                The two storey terraces with some four storey blocks of flats, are arranged in linked terraces to form
                interesting pedestrian courts and walkways. Garaging is in rear vehicular courts, which makes for some
                long carries for furniture vans etc, but this is part of the compromise. The terraces are virtually
                single aspect with gardens some of which conveniently connect to a garage. The eaves level was kept low
                by having a solid ground floor - no steps required, and a 150mm coomb ceiling at roof level. The
                external walls were built with 'silver grey' concrete facing bricks, perhaps a first for public housing.
                It was said that Scottish brickies could not lay facings as they were only used to laying commons for
                roughcast. Not true and rather condescending.

                The outer walls also had an insulating inner leaf block called 'Siporex'. This was in advance of it's
                time, went liquidate but is no newly produced by others. The ground floors had electric underfloor
                heading, though this was difficult to repair and electric block storage is probably now fitted. The
                running cost of this, hot water and machines is still only 2.2p per H.W.hour on some tarriffs. 150mm
                quilt insulation was also installed in the roofs. The insulation levels were about 30 years in front of
                the legistration . Catalogue kitchens were not then available, so purpose built units were fitted. The
                flat blocks had drying areas on the rood, now replaced with pitched tiles. At that time the Scottish
                Development Department would not approve landscape costs other than grass, but a willing Parks
                Department and tenants managed to do what can be seen in the photographs.

                These houses were built on the wartime Grangemouth airfield which operated between 1939 and 1945 when
                various Squadrons flew Spitfire and Hurricane fighters and Blenheim bombers. Secret testing of Mustarg
                Gas took place using Lysander aircraft and many Polish aircrew were also trained here. Sometimes you do
                not know the half of it!
